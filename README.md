# Updated AUM-HPU-HSI-Research on July 31, 2024
Modified AUM-HPU-HSI-Research toolbox including AUM2 dataset

## AUM2 Dataset
The AUM2 Dataset is adapted from the "CloudPatch-7 Hyperspectral Dataset" specifically: "CloudPatch7_HSI_dataset.zip	785.13 MB" by Dr. Kursun.
It can be found at: [https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/cloudpatch-7-hyperspectral-dataset](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/cloudpatch-7-hyperspectral-dataset)

### Adding the AUM2 Dataset to the custom_datasets.py
To added the AUM2 Dataset to the ```custom_datasets.py``` folder we must also have the 2 datasets in a mat file called ```AUM2_Dataset.mat``` and ```AUM2_gt.mat``` in the folders ```data/Datasets```
